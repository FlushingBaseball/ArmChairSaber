## Armchair Sabermetrics / Armchair Baseball (or as orginionally concieved ) Armchair Eppler

## Summary (Tl;DR)
Put your predictive ablilty to the test, predict the outcome of matchups before they go live. There's a leaderboard
and I'm working on not only having users compete against eachother but against different perdictive models. (long term goal is to let people send in models to compete)

## Predictions

# Beat the machines (Make predictions against different predictive models) 
People build models that try to predict the outcome of games. Some do it for an advantage in gambeling, some do it for the teams they work for as a profession and then Vegas does it the best. You the user get to see how the different models we have access to will predict each game and bet against them. 


## Watch
Watch games live via my implmentation of gameday

## Stats
Lookup stats, save them, use them, enjoy the best part about baseball that's not a warm day at the park (the math)



## Thoughts
The design is a bit loose but the color palette is coming along.
