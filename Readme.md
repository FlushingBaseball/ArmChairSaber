## Armchair Sabermetrics / Armchair Baseball (or as orginionally concieved ) Armchair Eppler

## Summary (Tl;DR)
Put your predictive ablilty to the test, predict the outcome of matchups before they go live. There's a leaderboard
and I'm working on not only having users compete against eachother but against different perdictive models. (long term goal is to let people send in models to compete)

## Watch
Watch games live via my implmentation of gameday

## Stats
Lookup stats, save them, use them, enjoy the best part about baseball that's not a warm day at the park (the math)
