## Summary (Tl;DR)
Put your predictive ability to the test, by predicting game outcomes against the userbase and predictive models.
There's a leaderboard and my implementation of gameday to watch games playout as they happen with pitch by pitch data.  

## Stats
Lookup stats, save them to collections, use them, enjoy the best part about baseball that's not a warm day at the park (the math).
Player cards will be revamped for the 2024 season.
