          <h3>What Stack does the site run on?</h3>
          <p>Currently it's a React front end with Python/Flask on the backend and sqlite as the database.
            This is probably going to change as time moves.

          <h3>What is the Leaderboard about?</h3>
          <p>Alot of smart people like baseball and I think the challenge to predict games is a blast. I'll be implementing some basic predictive models 
            so users can not only compete against eachother but also against a models. Eventually I will be allowing submissions of models to join the competition.
