# Spin Efficiency, The Age-Curve and Rich Hill's inevitable 2024 bounceback


## Is this the end?

No one has had a stranger, cooler career in baseball than Rich Hill (Seriously, click his face below a few times), but this article isn't about his long-storied history. The legend has not signed a contract; spring training is about to begin, and here at Armchair Sabermetrics, we're starting to worry if our hero has hung up his saddles. While age comes for us all, and Rich is definitely on the other side of the hill, there's plenty of good sabermetric reasons to believe he can be a very under-the-radar signing for a team. The aging curve may be the north star for most teams, guiding them through the rough waters of free agency, but a look at Hill's numbers shows it's not age-related decline that caused him to suffer the worst season of his career last year. Hill, despite being the oldest player in baseball, having the worst season of his career, and having an absurdly slow repertoire, looks prime to show up in 2024 and pitch well

Rich has said that he wants to pitch in 2024, he's even open to joining a team around the trade deadline to soak up innings after someone gets traded away and playoff hopes and dreams are shattered.
So allow me to make the case for him, last year was a fluke, his velocity has held, and his spin efficiency was still almost perfect. (If someone has Dick Monfort's email, please send him this; we think Rich should be a Colorado Rockie.)


## The bottom of the hill

For years, Rich Hill's curveball was a mesmerizing work of art on the pitching mound. With a sharp, late break and a tantalizing drop, it kept batters guessing and off-balance. Hill's masterful command of this pitch made it a formidable weapon throughout his career. The curveball's deceptive trajectory and unpredictable movement make it a challenging puzzle for hitters to solve regardless of the fact it's velocity was well below average. Whether he's using it to freeze batters in their tracks or induce weak grounders, Hill's curveball stood out as a signature element of his pitching repertoire. In 2023 that pitch took a dramatic turn for the worst. Exibit A

## Why slow down now?
As players age, they lose speed on their pitches, a phenomenon often attributed to a combination of factors such as damage to ligaments, overall muscle health, and a decrease in overall physical vitality.
The inevitable slowing down of pitches becomes a tangible measure of the wear and tear endured by ligaments, luckily for us Rich has actually gotten a bit faster over the last few seasons! He may have the slowest 
offerings in all of baseball but from the 2022 season to 2023 his fastball gained a 1/10th of a MPH, his change-up has gained 2 MPH since 2020 and his curveball has gained 2/10ths since 2021. MPH is a decent proxy for arm health a change in velocity in game often sends health trainers running to the mound to prevent a pitcher from doing further damage. 

## It's the movement, it's always the movement

The culprit behind the challenges Rich Hill faced in his pitching performance appears to stem from a substantial loss of over 1.5 inches in vertical movement, a critical factor distinguishing between a pitch sailing effortlessly past the bat and one destined to orbit Jupiter. Such a pronounced decline in movement serves as a stark warning sign, indicative of an underlying physical issue. When a player experiences a decrease in velocity, it signals that something may be amiss physically, warranting closer attention. Fortunately, the diminished movement on a pitch is often a reversible concern, with solutions found through targeted coaching and a meticulous examination of alterations in delivery or grip. In the case of Rich Hill, it has come to light that a persistent blistering issue plagued him throughout the latter part of the season, shedding light on the intricate interplay between physical health and pitching performance. This nuanced understanding underscores the multifaceted nature of a pitcher's journey and the resilience required to navigate through challenges, making the quest for optimal performance a dynamic and ever-evolving process.

When a football is thrown, the way it spins is known as Gyro Spin. This spin doesn't affect the ball's movement; instead, it stabilizes the ball on its travel plane. Pitchers aim to avoid this type of spin as it diminishes the pitch's movement, making it easier for batters to connect. Tracking the percentage of spin contributing to the movement is crucial in assessing pitch quality. Training focuses on increasing active spin to enhance a ball's sweeping or diving action, a key aspect of modern pitch development. Variations in spin types, such as backspin, topspin, and sidespin, directly impact movement. Hill demonstrated efficiency with spin, reaching almost 96 percent, but occasionally, this efficiency correlated with a collapse in the overall spin rate. Even with high efficiency, a lower total RPM can reduce the rate at which the ball's seams come to bare against the pitch plane as it travels, consequently diminishing its movement.


## Hey, why not guys? 

There's an opportunity here, not for greatness, but for entertainment, and hey, that's what sports are all about at the end of the day. A lot of teams aren't aiming to win the World Series in 2024. They a lack farm system loaded with prospects that would suffer from the opportunity cost of handing Hill the ball. It's going to be a long season (*cough* Rockies!). Someone should fork over some money, add their names to the long list of teams Rich has been on, ensuring their place in a legend and becoming a valid answer to the eventual trivial purist fact. He's healthy, we'll be running up that hill to see him pitch if he comes to town
but even if nobody signs him, as every baseball fan knows, there's always next year.
