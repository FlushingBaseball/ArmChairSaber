# Hope, bullpen construction and the art of the unkown.

It's the start of Spring training, there's alot of players on split and minor leauge deals showing up to camp ready to try and compete there way into the final sport on a roster. 
Theres AAA relievers looking to get their chance, theres guys who are looking for another shot who once preformed, theres guys that seem to never be out of a job like Oliver Perez
but every team is convinced that they have a shot at having a decent pen, they might not delulde themselves into thinking they're any good but a glance over at the pen and hey we might have something here!

The stats

W.A.R or wins above replacment is the go to, all in one, holloistic stat for judiging a baseball player, but if WAR has a major flaw its an inablity to give good relievers their just desserts.

The ability to build a bullpen is a still somewhat shouded in mystery, is churn incredibily important? that is taking the last few spots and only filling them with pitchers who still have minor leauge 
options in order to always have fresh arms avaialbe wihtout sorting through the waiver wire, is a proved track record important? Aaron loop, etc do you want to be paying for the season a reliever has just had?
or are you paying for the one their likley to have this season.
