As Spring training commences, unfortunately, hope is not universally in the air (looking at you, A’s). However, if there's one area where there's a universal sense of optimism, it's your team's bullpen. Players on split contracts and minor leaguers with one outstanding pitch are ready to compete for the final spot on a roster after an offseason of hard work. Those who struggled last season don’t have a ballooned ERA hovering over their heads, and those who excelled see no reason why this season should be any different. The mediocre are the happiest, free from expectations.

Every team can be convinced they have a genuine shot at having a decent bullpen, and it’s not just self-delusion. Glancing over at, say, the generally doomed A’s, Mason Miller could be one of the best relievers in the league with his stuff, Zach Jackson has been consistently good for two seasons, Trevor Gott had a FIP of 3.20 and was just unlucky, and Dany Jiménez and Lucas Erceg boast some promising underlying metrics.

Some of the most exciting teams that defied projection algorithms and competed in the playoffs did so because of effective bullpens. The 2012 Baltimore Orioles, projected to win just 70 games, went on to win 93 on the shoulders of FIVE amazing seasons from Jim Johnson (2.49 ERA), Luis Ayala (2.64), Darren O’Day (2.27), Pedro Strop (2.44), and Troy Patton (2.43). That kind of right side of the bell curve outcome is what every fan can dream of, regardless of what STEAMER, PECOTA, VEGAS, or any algorithmic or non-algorithmic entity says about their team. Bullpens become more important every year as starting pitchers throw fewer total innings.
